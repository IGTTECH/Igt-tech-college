         <p>There are important things you should pay attention to in order to learn how to repair a phone and there are steps to follow so that you do not get discouraged before completing all the necessary
courses.
First, convince yourself that it is necessary to learn all, think about their beauty and imagine when you will become an expert and people will tell each other that
what you failed at will not be able to do anywhere else</p>
<p>
You are asked to avoid skipping classes, if a student skips school classes, he will never succeed well and will end up dropping out of school, the same is the case when
you learn how to repair a phone, avoid skipping a certain course before you reach it because you love it, you must follow the following steps
and do not want to learn everything in one day, another thing is that you should first learn how to repair small phones(keypads mobile) that have become boring before learning how repair big ones, which are smartphones.
</p>
<p>First, you should read this entire introduction, learn all the necessary tools, then learn all the parts of the phone, learn how they work, learn how to remove and replace them, and learn what each part does when it breaks, for example, speakers, mics, charging systems,
glass, buttons, battery terminals, ICs, sim card slots, ear phone plugs and many more... once you know all of this,
then you can go to the next step and learn the following.
</p>
<p>
Now start learning and understanding smartphones, learn what makes up smartphones or big phones
and learn how they work, learn how to remove and replace them, and know what each component is and what causes it to die, for example, speakers, mics, charging systems,
glass, buttons, battery terminals, all types of ICs, sim card slots, phone plugs and many more.. as we will teach you, once you know how to fix a dead smartphone, you will go to the next step.
</p>
<p>
Now it's time to learn software, you must first know what the phone is and what makes it work without being seen by the human eyes, where you will connect it to a computer
know drivers and connection know firmware, scatter file, IMEI and Serial number what it does and what it does and how to change it, flashing, removing password
, removing FRP and knowing its operation, formatting and many more we will teach you if you stay with us.
and it will also require you to start with small phones and then learn them and then smartphones.
</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;"></h3>Two types of Mobile technicians</h3>
<p>You are required to choose between the two, namely Hardware and Software, you can choose one or both but avoid mixing them , first learn one and learn
     other and then you will learn everything and join the job and it would be good for you to knoe both, I wish you well.
</p>
<h3 style="color: brown">Software technicians</h3>
<p>They are the ones who repair phones that do not require anything to remove spares, from settings to complex ones that require a computer and many secrets of some that are not allowed
in some countries, they are not required to open the phone and you can even operate a phone in another country. </p>

<h3 style="color: brown;">Hardware technicians</h3>
<p>They are the ones who fix dead phones, such as removing the battery,speakers,mac,charging system or more and  replacing any part, and those who need to open the phone and access its hardware
are the ones who are handy.
